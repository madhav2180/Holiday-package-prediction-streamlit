"Trips & Travel.Com" seeks to establish a viable business model to expand its customer base by introducing a new offering: the Wellness Tourism Package. Wellness Tourism focuses on enabling travelers to maintain, enhance, or begin a healthy lifestyle while supporting overall well-being. Currently, the company offers five types of packages: Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, and King. An analysis of last year's data revealed that only 18% of customers purchased packages, with high marketing costs due to random customer targeting. To address this inefficiency, the company plans to leverage customer data to make marketing expenditures more effective.
Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) identified key customer characteristics influencing package purchases. Customers with the following attributes are more likely to purchase the Wellness Tourism Package:
Designation: Executives are prime targets.
Possession of a passport.
Residing in Tier 3 cities.
Marital Status: Single or unmarried.
Occupation: Large business owners.
Monthly income: Between 15,000 and 25,000.
Age range: 15â€“30 years.
Preference for 5-star properties.
Additionally, the project included deploying the model using Streamlit, a Python-based web app framework, to create an interactive interface for predictions. A chatbot was also developed to recommend suitable packages to customers based on their budget and preferences, enhancing the user experience and ensuring tailored offerings. Screenshots of the deployment interface and chatbot interactions are included to showcase practical implementation.
Using machine learning techniques, this project analyzes customer data to build a predictive model that identifies potential customers for the new package. By focusing on the most influential features such as designation, passport status, city tier, marital status, and occupation, this model supports decision-making for the marketing and policy teams, ensuring targeted outreach and optimized marketing costs. The report documents the methodology, analysis, results, and deployment insights, offering actionable guidance for successful product promotion.
